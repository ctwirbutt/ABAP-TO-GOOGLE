Purpose:

1) Authenticate with Google using a Refresh Token to Obtain an Access Token, and then

2) Create an ABAP function module that uses Access Tokens to do CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with Google (sql to Fusion Tables).

PreRequisites:

1) Set up a Google Account for your organization,

  1.1 Create a Fusion Table under this account
  
2) Enable your API access on Google's API Console

3) Use OAuth2.0 Google Playground to obtain a Refresh token
